KaQui
=====

KaQui helps learning kanjis. It takes the form of a quizz inspired from `Obenkyo <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Obenkyo>`_ to memorize kanji readings and meanings.

Features
========

Features include:

- Spaced repetition
- Show similar-looking kanjis in answers (taken from https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/35336 and http://lars.yencken.org/datasets/phd/)
- Clicking on kanji opens `aedict3 <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.baka.aedict3>`_ (a non-free japanese dictionary)
- Open source
- More to come

What makes it different from other apps:

- a "don't know" button which will make the question pop again soon without having to click on a random answer (which would make the answer pop again soon too)
- a "maybe" button which will make the question more likely to appear soon if the answer is correct
- a harsher penalty when the answer is wrong (you will need to get it right a lot of time for it to stop popping)
- kanjis similar to the one in the question are shown as answers to help you learn the subtle differences between them
- it's free

The quizzes are based on `kanjidic <http://www.edrdg.org/kanjidic/kanjidic.html>`_.
